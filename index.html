		<h3>General Assembly</h3>
		<h4>Web Development Immersive Remote</h4>
		<p>
			Full-stack web development program focused on common best practices in object-oriented programming, MVC frameworks and test-driven development. I learned to use JavaScript and the MEAN stack as well as Ruby on Rails. I completed projects such as a browser-based
			JavaScript blackjack game and a MEAN stack job search app that used LinkedIn's API for authentication and the GitHub Jobs API for finding job postings. This app was a team project that involved significant collaboration using git, Slack, Trello, and
			pair programming.

		<h3>Podcast Producer</h3>
		<p>
			I hosted and produced several podcasts with weekly audiences of around 5,000 each. These shows were largely focused on international news and events, particularly current events in the Middle East. I handled all aspects of pre-production, recording, editing,
			and monetization of the content. This work gave me plenty of experience shipping on deadline and receiving feedback, both positive and negative.

		<h3>US Army</h3>
		<p>
			I served two tours to Iraq as an infantry team and squad leader. I was responsible for 4-8 soldiers as well as various aspects of mission planning and execution. The army instilled in me the belief that teamwork is critical and that you must be flexible
			and creative to find a way to get the job done.
